# PredictNephritis
The nephritis prediction program is a machine learning tool written in R that uses two algorithms, k nearest neighbors and classification tree, to predict the likelihood of a patient developing nephritis. Nephritis is a kidney disorder that can have serious consequences if left untreated, so the ability to predict which patients are at risk can be very valuable in preventing the disease or managing it effectively.

To create the prediction model, the program uses a dataset of patient records containing information on various factors that may influence the risk of nephritis, such as age, gender, medical history, and lifestyle factors. The program applies the k nearest neighbors and classification tree algorithms to this dataset to create a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of nephritis based on these factors.

Once the prediction model has been created, the program can be used to analyze new patient records and predict the likelihood of nephritis. This can be very helpful in identifying patients who are at high risk of developing the disease, so that they can receive appropriate medical care and take steps to prevent or manage the condition.
